Generalized Nuclear Data (GNDS)
===============================

GNDS or Generalized Nuclear Database Structure is the new standard for storing evaluated and processed nuclear data.
The latest version of the standard is version 2.0 (publication forthcoming). Documentation for the previous standard
(v1.9) is available from `the NEA webpage <https://www.oecd-nea.org/jcms/pl_39689/specifications-for-the-generalised-nuclear-database-structure-gnds?details=true>`

You can find out more about the goals of GNDS and FUDGE from an older publication `C. Mattoon, et al.,
Nuclear Data Sheets, Volume 113, Issue 12, December 2012, Pages 3145--3171 
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nds.2012.11.008/>`_.
