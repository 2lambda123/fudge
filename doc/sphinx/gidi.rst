Generalized Interaction Data Interface (GIDI)
=============================================

GIDI is a C++ API for reading (and eventually writing) GNDS files. It is being developed at LLNL,
and is used by the LLNL codes Mercury (Monte Carlo transport) and ARDRA (deterministic transport).
An older version of GIDI has also been released as part of the G4LEND package in GEANT4.

GIDI has been released as part of a larger package called 'GIDIplus', available from
https://github.com/LLNL/gidiplus. GIDIplus includes access routines for PoPs databases and GNDS files,
along with other supporting libraries.
