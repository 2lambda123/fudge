The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follows.

			GNU Terms and Conditions for Copying, Distribution, and Modification

	0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder
saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program," below, refers to any such
program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or trans-
lated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each
licensee is addressed as "you."

	Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside
its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its
contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
is true depends on what the Program does.

	1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium,
provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer
of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical
act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
2	You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the
Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also
meet all of these conditions:
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of
any change.
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the
Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
License.
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running
for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users
may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from
the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its
terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate work. But when you distribute the same
section as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
regardless of who wrote it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you;
rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the
Program.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the
Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
3 	You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable
form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more
than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
interchange; or,
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This
alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or
executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work,
complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)
with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless
that component itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering
equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

	4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this
License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
2	You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you
permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do
not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you
indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or
modifying the Program or works based on it.
3	Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives
a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients’ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
4	If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not
limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then
as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-
free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way
you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the
section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
It is not the purpose to this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest
validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to
the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is
up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee
cannot impose that choice.


This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

1	If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by
copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
License.
	9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time
to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which
applies to it and “any later version,” you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version
of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this
License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 2	If you wish to incorporate parts
of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision to grant permission will be guided by the two goals of preserving the
free status of all derivatives of our free software and or promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally .

NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM
"AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.
2	IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER
PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING
BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS


Description: Welcome to FUDGE (For Updating Data and GEnerating Evaluations), a nuclear data platform built in python that permits
        reading, viewing, modifying, writing and processing of nuclear data. FUDGE is a product of the Computational Nuclear
        Physics Group (CNP) at Lawrence Livermore National Lab (LLNL).
        
        This current release of Fudge focuses on introducing the new Generalized Nuclear Data (GND) format, intended to
        modernize storage of nuclear data. The package includes tools to translate other formats to and from GND, plus tools
        for testing and visualizing GND-formatted data.
        
        Contents of this README:
            - 1) Getting Started
            - 2) Basic Use (translating ENDF files)
            - 3) Plotting
            - 4) Getting Help
            - 5) Notes on translated ENDF files
        
            More information is also available in the GND manual (fudge-2.0/doc/GND_beta2_manual.pdf) and in
        fudge-2.0/doc/code-ref
        
        1) Getting Started:
          Fudge is designed to be simple to install and use. For basic use the package only requires python (version 2.4-2.7).
        Python is likely already present on all unix-based systems (if in doubt, try entering "python" on the command-line),
        and is available for all platforms at www.python.org/getit
        
          To install the package:
            1) obtain the current version (available online at nuclear.llnl.gov), and place it on your system.
            2) to unzip the package, type
                >tar -xvf fudge-2.0.tar.gz
            3) The unzipped directory is named 'fudge-2.0'. Navigate into the new directory, and type 
                >make
               this builds extra tools for better performance. If you encounter errors at this step, you can still use the ENDF
               translation tool but advanced features will be unavailable.
            3) You are now set to use Fudge! For advanced use, see the optional components below.
        
          [Optional] Extra python packages: For more advanced use, Fudge depends on these additional, optional packages:
            gnuplot and Gnuplot.py (for plotting, http://gnuplot-py.sourceforge.net)
            matplotlib (alternate style of plotting, http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net)
            numpy (for some advanced features including checking and manipulating covariance matrices, http://numpy.scipy.org)
        
          [Optional] Setting Environment Variables: for general use of the fudge package, some changes should be made to your
        computer's environment. The following lines make the required change. Note that <path_to_fudge> indicates the path to
        the directory containing this README file:
        
          on unix with bash, ksh, etc, put this line in the .bashrc or equivalent:
            export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<path_to_fudge>
        
          on csh, tcsh or similar, do:
            setenv PYTHONPATH $PYTHONPATH:<path_to_fudge>
        
          on Windows, the environment variable should be added to the registry (see for example
               http://www.support.tabs3.com/main/R10463.htm)
        
          [Optional] Building Extensions: Fudge is primarily written in python, which is easily portable across many different
        systems. Some advanced features of fudge (computationally intensive tasks) are however implemented in c or fortran, and
        must be compiled before use. To build these extensions, use the Makefile included in this directory:
            >make
        
          If you encounter trouble with installing, building extensions or setting environment variables, please let us know
             (email: mattoon1@llnl.gov)
        
        
        2) Basic Use:
          After installing Fudge, most users will be interested in translating ENDF files to the new format and in measuring how
        well the translation works. Two tools for translating ENDF are included in the 'bin' directory:
        
          rePrint.py: translate one ENDF-formatted file to GND, then translate back to ENDF for comparison with the original.
        Usage:
            <path_to_fudge>/bin/rePrint.py filename.endf
          Several files are produced:
            -test.endf6.xml	(the gnd-formatted file)
            -test.endf6-covar.xml  (covariances in gnd, produced only if the original file has covariances)
            -test.endf6.noLineNumbers  (the gnd file translated back to ENDF format)
            -test.endf6.orig.noLineNumbers  (the original ENDF file with line numbers stripped for easy comparison)
        
          After running rePrint.py, you may wish to compare the original/new ENDF files using diff,kompare, etc:
            >diff test.endf6.orig.noLineNumbers test.endf6.noLineNumbers
        
          See Section 5 below for a discussion of the most common differences between original/translated ENDF files.
        
          Another tool included in the release is 'rePrintSample.py'. This is very similar to rePrint, except it randomly picks 
        an ENDF-formatted file from the included samples.
        
        3) Making Plots:
          After translating an ENDF file to GND, fudge can be used to make plots from the data. Plotting in fudge may require
        installing extra components (gnuplot and/or matplotlib). A sample plotting script is included in the 'examples'
        directory:
          >python <path_to_fudge>/examples/plotCrossSection.py
        
        4) Getting Help:
          Documentation in html is packaged along with Fudge. To view the documentation, open the file "doc/code-ref/index.html"
        inside fudge. This offers extensive documentation of all the python code included in the package, and is meant to be
        used as a reference.
          For other questions about the package, please feel free to contact the maintainer at mattoon1@llnl.gov
        
        5) Notes on translated ENDF files:
          When translating from ENDF, you may notice some substantial differences between the original and re-translated file.
        Some differences are due to sections that are not yet translated to the new format (for example, ENDF file 32 containing
        resonance parameter covariances is not yet translated). Other differences include:
            - masses, which appear many times in ENDF and are often inconsistent. In a GND file, the mass is stored only once,
        so upon translation back to ENDF inconsistent masses are overwritten.
            - interpolation regions: ENDF files permit using different interpolation (lin-lin, log-lin, etc) in different
        regions. GND also supports this, but where possible we have merged two or more regions into a single region (for
        example, 'flat' interpolation regions can be merged with lin-lin regions with no loss of precision).
            - Improperly-formatted ENDF files: the GND translation tool strictly interprets the ENDF format as defined in the
        June 2010 version of the ENDF manual (available at https://ndclx4.bnl.gov/gf/project/endf6man). Some differences come
        from files in the ENDF library that do not strictly follow the format. As a common example, some ENDF files contain
        non-zero data in a reserved field. After translation, the entry is reset to '0'.
