Installation
============

pqu is designed to be simple to install and use. For basic use the package only 
requires Python (versions 2.4-2.7, not version 3.0 and higher).  Python is 
likely already present on all unix-based systems (if in doubt, try entering 
"python" on the command-line), and is available for all platforms at 
http://www.python.org/getit/.


[Optional] Setting Environment Variables
----------------------------------------

For general use of the pqu package, some changes should be made to your 
computer's environment. The following lines make the required change. Note that 
<path_to_pqu> indicates the path to the directory containing the 
physicalQuantityWithUncertainty.py file:

* On unix with bash, ksh, etc, put this line in the .bashrc or equivalent:

    ::

        $export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<path_to_pqu>

* On csh, tcsh or similar, do:

    ::

        $setenv PYTHONPATH $PYTHONPATH:<path_to_pqu>

* On Windows, the environment variable should be added to the registry 
  (see for example http://www.support.tabs3.com/main/R10463.htm)
